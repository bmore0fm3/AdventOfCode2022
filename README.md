# AdventOfCode2022

The [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is a yearly coding challenge that takes place in December. I am using the challenges to learn the [ooREXX language](https://oorexx.org/). 

Use the OORexxUnit test framework & Test Driven Development to help with puzzle. 

Using TDD idea of Red -> Green -> Refactor
